# Statement
Define an algorithm that is able to convert temperatures from Celsius to Fahrenheit and vice versa.

# Solution

## Temperature 🌡️

1. Choose one of the following options:
    - Convert to Celsius from Fahrenheit
    - Convert to Farenheit from Celsius
2. If you selected to convert from Celsius to Fahrenheit go to the label `Celsius to Fahrenheit` else if you selected to convert from Farenheit to Celsius go to the label `Farenheit to Celsius`


## `Celsius to Fahrenheit`

3. Enter temperature in degrees Celsius
4. The value obtained from the entered temperature multiplied by 1.8
5. To the result obtained in step 4 add 32
6. The result is converted to degrees Fahrenheit
7. Go to the label `Finish`


## `Fahrenheit to Celsius`

3. Enter temperature in degrees Farenheit
4. Subtract 32 from the value obtained from the temperature entered
5. The result obtained in the previous step divide it by 1.8
6. The result is converted to degrees Celsius
7. Go to the label `Finish`

## `Finish`
8. End
