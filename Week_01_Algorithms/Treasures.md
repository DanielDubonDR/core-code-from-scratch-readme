# Solution
---
## Find the treasure
- Are three chests. 
- We know that at least one has a treasure in it. 
- Each chest has a message, but all the messages are lies.

`Left chest:` is liying so the B chest does not contain a treasure.

`Middle chest:` is lying, some of the chests may contain treasure.

`Right chest:` is lying, there may be more than one treasure

### Result
``` The chest A and chest C have a treasure ```
