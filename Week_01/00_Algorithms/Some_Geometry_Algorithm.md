Design an algorithm to calculate the volume of a pyramid, a cube and a sphere.

# Solution
---
1. Choose one of the following options:
    - Calculate the volume of a pyramid
    - Calculate the volume of a cube
    - Calculate the volume of a sphere
2. If you selected calculate the volume of a pyramid go to the label `Volume of a pyramid` else if you selected calculate the volume of a cube go to the label `Volume of a cube` else if you selected calculate the volume of a sphere go to the label `Volume of a sphere`


## `Volume of a pyramid`

3. Enter the width of the base of the pyramid.
4. Enter the length of the pyramid base
5. Enter the height of the pyramid
6. Multiply the width, length and height of the pyramid.
7. To the result of the multiplication obtained from the previous step, divide it within 3
8. The result is the volumen of a pyramid
9. Go to the label `Finish`


## `Volume of a cube`

3. Enter the side of a cube
4. Cube the data entered in the previous step
5. The result is the volumen of a cube
6. Go to the label `Finish`

## `Volume of a sphere`
3. Enter the radius of the sphere
4. Cube the data entered in the previous step
5. The result of the previous step multiply for Ï€
6. The result of the previous step multiply for 4/3
7. The result is the volumen of a sphere
8. Go to the label `Finish`

## `Finish`
- End
