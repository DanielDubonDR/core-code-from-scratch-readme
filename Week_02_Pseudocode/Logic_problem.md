# Statement
---
The teacher asks his 5 students if they studied mathematics yesterday.

Alice: "Nobody studied math yesterday".
Bob: "1 person studied math yesterday".
Charlie: "2 people studied math yesterday".
Dan: "3 people studied mathematics yesterday".
Eva: "4 people studied mathematics yesterday".

The teacher knows that only those who studied would be telling the truth and those who didn't would be lying. Who is telling the truth?

# Solution
---
If we assume Alice is telling the truth, that means no one studied.

If Charlie is telling the truth, two people studied. But if he is telling the truth, no one else can tell the truth.

The only possible solution left is Bob, since he may be telling the truth and be the only one who studied.
### Answer
        Bob is telling the truth
